## WANT TO LEARN WEB DEV ??

I have put together a website with all the resources I know of, for people who wanna get started with Web Development.
> You are in the right place.

Many people have asked me how to learn web development and instead of repeating myself again I have written down all my thoughts in this webpage.
Correct me if I'm wrong and these are my own thoughts it may work for you or it may not, read it do your own research and see what you like.
I think technologies are just the tools to help you solve the problems one may be good fit for your problem other might not be. Best programming language doesn't exists it.

Feel free to connect with me and have a conversation.
